#SERIES TRACKER
This is a Tracker for watching Series online. Programming is a hobby, 
so the code won't be efficient and at times might be hard to read. 
I try my best to keep it clean. Feedback on improvements is always welcome.

Still in development currently it will only support __*bs.to*__ for testing. 
I will try to integrate Netflix and Amazon prime in the future. 
**The login to these will always be manual!**

current version uses Python 3.7
